# What's Reactive Programming?

There are plenty of bad explanations and definitions out there on the net. Let's cut the bullshit.

> Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams

In a way, this isn't aything new. Event buses or your typical click events are really an asynchronous event stream, on which you
can observe and do some side effects. Reactive is that idea on steroids. You are able to create data streams of anything, not just
from click and hover events. Streams are cheap and uniquitions, anything can be a stream: variables, user inputs, properties, caches, data structures, etc.

On top of that, you are given an amazing toolbox of functions to **combine, create and filter** any of those streams.
